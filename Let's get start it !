# Install Helm on Windows

I'm using Windows 10, but it also works on your Win 7

## Download installation file
    Download from https://get.helm.sh/helm-v2.16.9-windows-amd64.zip
    Unzip it and save the helm-v2.16.9-windows-amd64 folder on your local folder !
      let's say on C:\Users\admin\Documents\helm-v2.16.9-windows-amd64

## Save it on Environtment Variables
    On File Explorer: 
      "Right click" ThisPC > Properties > Advanced System Settings
    On User variables for admin:
      Click "New", type "Helm" on Variable & "C:\Users\admin\Documents\helm-v2.16.9-windows-amd64" on Value > click OK !
      Select "Path" > click "New" and type "Helm" on Variable & "C:\Users\admin\Documents\helm-v2.16.9-windows-amd64" on Value > click OK !
    OK > OK ... until all windows closed :P
    
## Open Powershell as Administrator
    Go to folder you want to initialize the Helm
    Let's type :
      $ kubectl -n kube-system delete deployment tiller-deploy
      $ kubectl -n kube-system delete service/tiller-deploy
      $ helm init
      $ helm init --upgrade

## Happy helming :D !
